# Chrome extensions

<p>
  A Chrome extension is a plugin that influences the behavior of your Chrome browser. You can build personal extensions that 
  retreive and display information you look up frequently in a convenient popup, or you could publish extensions for users
  around the world to benefit from. 
  <br>Let's take a brief look at Chrome extensions and their architectures.
</p>

### New-tab / theme scripts

<p>
  These extensions change the default tab that opens in Google Chrome or change the overall look of your browser with 
  custom definitions for the theme. 
  <br>
  For an instance of a new tab, check out 
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-for-a-cause/gibkoahgjfhphbmeiphbcnhehbfdlcgo">
    Tab for a cause
  </a>.
  
  For an example of a theme extension, check out
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-for-google-chr/annfbnbieaamhaimclajlajpijgkdblo">
    Dark Theme for Google Chrome
  </a>. 
</p>

### Background scripts

<p>
  Extensions of this type run scripts in the background ie. run automatically as you browse the web without requiring much / any 
  interaction with the extension itself.
  <br>
  One example is 
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/likefree/hejgbghjhjiilikhjinpbooockoiipek">
      LikeFree
    </a> -- the extension automatically handles the discovery and freeing of the likes on Facebook and Instagram,
   all you have to do is install the extension.
</p>

### Popup extensions

<p>
  Popup extensions are background scripts that come with a menu for users to modify the behavior of the extension.
  <br>
  A simple demonstration is the 
  <a href="https://github.com/mrvivacious/ahegao">
    ahegao Chrome extension
  </a>. ahegao replaces all the images on a website with a selection of
   anime images from a category the user selects.
   <br>
  An extensive example is the 
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/porno-porn-blocker-beta/fnfchnplgejcfmphhboehhlpcjnjkomp">
   PorNo! adult-blocker extension
  </a>. Users add links to websites of positive, inspirational etc content
  to the extension. When a user attempts to visit an adult site, instead of being shown a "This page is blocked" page, the user
  is redirected to a randomly-selected saved link in an attempt to provide a distraction or outlet for the user's energy.
</p>

## What are we building?

<p>
  For this class, we will be building a small background script that you can later extend to a popup extension.
